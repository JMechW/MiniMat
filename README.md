# MiniMat

This Matrix Calculation Source Code is specially designed for Microchip Processor Programming.

The source code is not optimized and has many deficiencies (lacking failsafe features). However, it is compatibale with standard C++. It also does not require runtime type identification (fno-rtti) and exceptions (fno-exceptions). When carefully used, the source code can be extremely efficient.

More features will arrive on future updates.
